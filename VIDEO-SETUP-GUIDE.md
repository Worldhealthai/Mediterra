# How to Add Video to Your Hero Section

Your website is now set up to display a video background in the hero section! Here's how to add the video:

## Option 1: Download from Mixkit (Easiest - Free, No Sign-up)

1. Visit: https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/underwater/
2. Browse and find a video you like (look for calm underwater or ocean waves)
3. **Recommended videos:**
   - "Blue water in the sea" - Calm underwater footage
   - "Ocean waves from underwater" - Beautiful wave movement
   - "Underwater ocean currents" - Peaceful underwater scene
4. Click the video thumbnail
5. Click the **"Free Download"** button (select Medium or Large HD)
6. Save the file as `hero-ocean.mp4`
7. Place it in your project root directory (same folder as index.html)

## Option 2: Download from Pexels

1. Visit: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/underwater/
2. Find a video (search: "underwater ocean", "ocean waves", "blue water")
3. Click the video
4. Click **"Download"** and select "HD" or "Full HD"
5. Rename the file to `hero-ocean.mp4`
6. Place it in your project root directory

## Option 3: Use Your Own Video

If you have footage of your actual mussel farm:
1. Convert to MP4 format (H.264 codec recommended)
2. Keep file size under 15MB for fast loading
3. Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
4. Name it `hero-ocean.mp4`
5. Place in project root directory

## Current Status

✅ HTML structure is ready (video element added)
✅ CSS styling is complete (full-screen coverage, mobile support)
✅ Fallback image will show until you add the video

The hero section will automatically use your beautiful ocean background image until you add the video file. Once you place `hero-ocean.mp4` in the project folder, the video will start playing automatically!
